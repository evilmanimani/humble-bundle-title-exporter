# HumbleBundle Key Exporter

A bookmarklet to export [your HumbleBundle game titles](https://www.humblebundle.com/home/keys) that will download that data in a formatted text file. This is meant for personal use.

## Usage

- Create a bookmark in your browser and name it what you like
- Edit the address field and [paste the copied contents of dist/bookmarklet-loader.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/javierjulio/humble-bundle-key-exporter/master/dist/bookmarklet-loader.js)
- Go to [your HumbleBundle Keys page](https://www.humblebundle.com/home/keys) and click the bookmark
- Once parsing is complete, a file named `humble-bundle-titles.txt` will be downloaded

Note: the bookmarklet code is in ES6 only. This will work in Safari 10.1+, Chrome 55+, Firefox 52+ and Edge 15+.
